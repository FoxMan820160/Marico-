                    <h2>We exist to help creators <br>
                        own their audience.</h2>
                    <p>We believe that social platforms are taking advantage of creators. <br>
                        We want to change that and help creators fight back. </p>

                    <p>Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's <br>
                        land. While social platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience, <br>
                        your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text <br>
                        message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight, <br>
                        millions of creative people almost lost their careers. </p>
                    <p>If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer <br>
                        favours you, are you prepared? </p>
                    <p>If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable <br>
                        distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you <br>
                        build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These <br>
                        distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when <br>
                        you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your <br>
                        content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your <br>
                        acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your <br>
                        audience. </p>
                    <p>We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional<br>
                        solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring<br>
                        someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you<br>
                        get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text<br>
                        message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it<br>
                        automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We<br>
                        believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build<br>
                        your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is<br>
                        share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest. </p>
                    <p>You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks <br>
                        to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your <br>
                        content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours. </p>
                    <p>For too long, social platforms have taken advantage of creators. Fight back and <br>
                        build an audience that you own. </p>
